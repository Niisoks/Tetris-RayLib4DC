Anyone is free to do whatever they want with the code in this project as long as it respects the licenses of the assets you use.

## Purpose of this Repository
This is a simple recreation of tetris created using raylib following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVYKG_ch4yM) by youtuber "[Programming With Nick](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithnick)". I wanted to create a game for the sega dreamcast and get it running on actual hardware, but don't actually have any real experience with dreamcast homebrew development or C/C++ development, so this repository is going to show my whole learning process.

## Ball example
At the start of the tutorial, Nick [shows off a template repository](https://github.com/educ8s/Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE-V2/tree/main). I ported this over first and it might be a good place to get started with Raylib development on the dreamcast. 

This template Ball Example is stored in the [BallTemplate branch](https://github.com/Niisoks/Tetris-RayLib4DC/tree/BallTemplate) in this repository
