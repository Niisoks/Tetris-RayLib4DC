# Tetris-RayLib4DC
A simple recreation of Tetris using raylib and kallistios that runs on the sega dreamcast.

Anyone is free to do whatever they want with the code in this project.

## Purpose of this Repository
This is a simple recreation of tetris created using raylib following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVYKG_ch4yM) by youtuber "[Programming With Nick](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithnick)". I wanted to create a game for the sega dreamcast and get it running on actual hardware, but don't actually have any real experience with dreamcast homebrew development or C/C++ development, so this repository is going to show my whole learning process.

## Learning goals in this repository
- [ ] Understand and use C/C++
- [ ] Get a grasp of RayLib4DC
- [ ] General use of WSL
- [ ] Make a responsive dreamcast game
- [ ] Get to grips with KallistiOS' apis
    - [ ] Efficiently use the debugger
    - [ ] Understand the controller api (shouldn't be too hard tho)
- [ ] Become a better more organised developer
- [ ] Get a running self-booting cdi
